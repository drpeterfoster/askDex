## Welcome

This is an AWS Lambda function that queries Dexcom Share for blood glucose readings.

It was originally mirrored from [jevans12](https://github.com/jevans12) and you can find it [HERE](https://jevans12.github.io/ask-dex/) and it comes with a wonderful [how-to](https://jevans12.github.io/ask-dex/ask/dex/update/2017/02/04/ask-dex.html) as well.
